## BiRRe Configuration (Defaults)
##
## This file contains project-wide default settings. Do not edit this file for
## local changes. Instead, create a sibling file named `config.local.toml` and
## put your overrides there. The loader applies the following precedence
## (lowest â†’ highest):
##   config.toml  <  config.local.toml  <  environment  <  CLI flags
##
## See README for details and examples.

[bitsight]
# API key used to authenticate against BitSight APIs.
# Prefer setting via environment (BITSIGHT_API_KEY) or CLI.
# api_key = "bs_api_key_goes_here"

# Defaults used for creating ephemeral BitSight subscriptions.
# Override via BIRRE_SUBSCRIPTION_FOLDER/BIRRE_SUBSCRIPTION_TYPE or CLI flags.
subscription_folder = "API"
subscription_type = "continuous_monitoring"

[runtime]
# Operational switches. These can also be controlled via environment variables
# (BIRRE_SKIP_STARTUP_CHECKS, BIRRE_DEBUG) or CLI flags.
# Set to true to skip startup checks (not recommended outside controlled environments).
# skip_startup_checks = false

# Enable verbose debug logging and diagnostic payloads.
# debug = false

[logging]
# Configure logging defaults. Each key can also be set via environment
# variables (BIRRE_LOG_LEVEL, BIRRE_LOG_FORMAT, BIRRE_LOG_FILE,
# BIRRE_LOG_MAX_BYTES, BIRRE_LOG_BACKUP_COUNT) or corresponding CLI flags.
# level  = "INFO"
# format = "text"      # alternatives: "json"
# file   = "birre.log" # leave commented to log to stderr only
# max_bytes    = 10000000
# backup_count = 5
