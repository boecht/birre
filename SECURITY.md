# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We currently support the latest **stable release** of BiRRe.
Older stable releases are considered end-of-life and will not receive security fixes.
Pre-production versions (alpha, beta, release candidates) are not covered by this policy.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it privately via
[GitHub Security Advisories](https://github.com/boecht/birre/security/advisories).
This keeps the report confidential until a fix is available.

Include as much detail as possible so we can reproduce and triage the problem.

We aim to acknowledge new security reports within **five business days**. Once
triaged, we will keep you updated on remediation progress until the fix is
available or the report is declined.
