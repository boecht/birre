# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We currently support the latest release line of BiRRe. Older releases are
considered end-of-life and will not receive security fixes.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, please open a new issue on the
[GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/boecht/birre/issues) with the
`security` label. Include as much detail as possible so we can reproduce and
triage the problem.

We aim to acknowledge new security reports within **five business days**. Once
triaged, we will keep you updated on remediation progress until the fix is
available or the report is declined.
